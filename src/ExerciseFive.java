    In line 1-4 a loop loops 10 times and generates random integers
    by calling a methode that generates
    from 0 to 10 (not including 0 and 10) (from line 9 - 11) and prints them each time it loops.
    Then it prints (in a new line) "Random integers generated".
    This is all done within a main methode.
