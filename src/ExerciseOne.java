    Inheritance is one of the four pillars of Object orientated programming (OOP), that takes it definition,
    well known in the animal world, from getting/ sharing abilities of the species group which an animal is born into.
    When inheritance is used within programming, it is used from a parent class to child classes, that are "born"
    with the same attributes and eventually methods as the parents class.
